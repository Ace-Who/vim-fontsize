Change font size easily.

## Usage

Run `:Fontsize` and press `+` (or `=`) and `-` repeatedly to increase and decrease the font size respectively. It changes font size by 0.5 in height or width every time. Press `<Esc>` to quit the state of changing font size.

This plugin works by changing option `guifont`. Read `:help 'guifont'` to find if your system uses this option.
